    <div class="content-block">
      <p><a href="http://semat.org/what-is-it-and-why-should-you-care-">SEMAT</a> is a community of people (about 2000), some companies (including ABB, Ericsson, Fujitsu UK, Huawei and TCS), and some universities around the world (including Carnegie Mellon West, Free University of Bozen Bolzano, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Tsinghua University and University of Twente), supporting an initiative to create a common ground, a kernel or a foundation for software engineering; something that has been missing until now.  Today there are seven chapters of SEMAT around the world: China, India, Japan, Korea, Latin America, Russia and South Africa.</p>

      <p>Today software development is more of a craft and less of an engineering discipline.  It is based on practices formulated as rules of thumbs instead of standing on a scientific foundation. SEMAT helps organizations to move from relying on software development as a craft only (as typically with agile today) to being an engineering discipline - still of course being agile.</p>

      <p>In practice this means better software, faster and with happier customers - and these improvements are measurable.</p>

      <p>Another key value expected from deploying Essence is that organizations become learning organizations.</p>
